Feature: Create menu show page
  As a visitor
  In order to select dishes from a menu
  I would like to be able to visit a menu page and see the restaurants menu name

    | name        |
    | NisseKebbab |
   Given the following menus exist
    | name            |
    | Nisses Takeaway |

  Scenario: I create an menu page and the menuÂ´s name i displayed
    Given I am on the restaurant menu page
    And I should see "Menu"
    And I should see "NisseKebbab"
    Then I should see "Nisses Takeaway"
